## Breakout for your browser

_This is a work in progress_

Breakout for your browser writte in plain old javascript.

Don't let the ball get past your paddle.

Collision detection is working-ish, though things get a lot messy when the ball
hits the side of the browser.  Collisions with bricks are also messy.

Mousewheel up makes the ball move faster, mousewheel down slows things up.
